# About PMM

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

PMM runs in the cloud, on-prem, or across hybrid platforms. It's supported by our [legendary expertise][percona_services] in open source databases, and by a vibrant developer and user [community].

A minimal PMM set-up comprises one [server](reference/index.md#pmm-server) and a [client agent](reference/index.md#pmm-client) on every system you want to monitor.

Here's how the home page looks on our <a href='https://pmmdemo.percona.com/' target='_blank'>free, live demo system</a>.
