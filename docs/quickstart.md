# Quickstart Guide


This guide covers how you can quickly get started using PMM.


## Prerequisites

The following are the prerequisites for using PMM:


- Docker compatible *nix based systems
- Docker

You can use the [easy installation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/server/easy-install.html) script that will verify and install any missing software and dependencies. To use it, run the command with sudo privileges or as root.
