Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operationsâ€”regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights

- PostgreSQL allows per-database metrics collection and control of parameters, enabling more granular data gathering without overusing connections.

- Data collection for PostgreSQL replication slots. Additional data about the replication slot name and used plugin are collected and stored in PMM.

- [Tech Preview] PMM Self-monitoring.
