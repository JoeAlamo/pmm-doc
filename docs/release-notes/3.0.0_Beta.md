Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operationsâ€”regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights

Your improved version is excellent. It's more structured, concise, and clearly emphasizes the breaking nature of the change. Here's a slightly refined version based on your improvement:

### Breaking API changes

#### Removed database ID prefixes

We have removed prefixes from database record identifiers (IDs) in PMM to improve REST API compatibility and simplify ID handling.

This change affects various components, including nodes, agents, services, and backup-related entities. As a result:

- Database identifiers are now represented as plain UUIDs without prefixes (e.g., `/node_id/`, `/agent_id/`, `/service_id/`).
- API endpoints using IDs as path parameters now use a new format
- Exporter passwords (previously identical to the prefixed `agent_id`) have changed
- Metrics labels that used `agent_id` have been updated

**Impact**
Make sure to update any custom scripts, integrations, or alerts that rely on the old exporter ID format to ensure compatibility with this new structure.
