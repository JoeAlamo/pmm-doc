Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operations—regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights


### Debian 12(Bookworm) pmm-client packages

Starting with PMM 2.41.2, we now offer pmm-client packages for the latest version of Debian. You can install these packages by following the instructions in our [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/client/index.html#package-manager).

### New experimental dashboards

    These **experimental** dashboards are subject to change. It is recommended to use these dashboards for testing purposes only.

#### PostgreSQL Checkpoints, Buffers, and WAL Usage Dashboard

In our continuous effort to enhance our dashboards, we have introduced this new experimental dashboard that provides more data about your PostgreSQL instances.

By leveraging this data, administrators can gain insights into their PostgreSQL servers and fine-tune their performance. Understanding and managing checkpoints, buffers, and WAL usage contribute to a well-performing and reliable PostgreSQL environment.

If you’re looking for in-depth insights into this dashboard, refer to our [blog post](https://www.percona.com/blog/postgresql-checkpoints-buffers-and-wal-usage-with-percona-monitoring-and-management/).
