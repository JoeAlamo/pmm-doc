Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operationsâ€”regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights

### Grafana upgrade and improved user experience in PMM

PMM now incorporates Grafana v10.4, bringing significant enhancements to navigation for a smoother user experience. This update delivers a revamped header with search, breadcrumbs, and a reorganized menu that groups related tools together, making it easier to navigate PMM's features and find what you need:

As part of these Grafana UI updates, we took the opportunity to refine the workfow for creating alerts  **Alert rule template** page. You'll notice improved organization on the page and clearer options for working with new alert rules and templates.

In addition, the PMM-related configuration and inventory options have been relocated from the **Administration** menu to a dedicated **PMM Configuration** section. This adjustment ensures easier, centralized to all PMM configuration settings.

### More options for deploying PMM rootless

In addition to Podman, PMM Server can also now be deployed rootless with Helm, Docker, Virtual Appliance, or Amazon AWS. 

This setup prioritizes security by eliminating the need for root privileges to create, run, and manage containers. Running PMM Server as a non-root user means that you never have to give a user root permission on the host. This adds an extra security layer, crucial in safeguarding against potential security breaches.

For detailed instructions on deploying rootless PMM, check the [Setting up PMM Server](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/index.html#set-up-pmm-server) topic.

## Enhanced PMM deployment on AMI and OVF environments

PMM is now deployed inside containers within AMI and OVF instances. These containers operate in a rootless mode and are managed via Podman. This approach significantly increases security for a more robust and secure monitoring for your environments.
