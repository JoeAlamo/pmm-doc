Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operationsâ€”regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights

PMM version 3.x marks a new milestone for PMM, now built on a more secure foundation, with an enhanced user experience and easier deployment across a broader range of environments.

## Improved security

### Service Accounts

With the release of PMM 3.x, we've made a significant enhancement to the way API authentication is handled. PMM no longer relies on API keys as the primary method for controlling access to the PMM Server components and resources. Instead, PMM now leverages Grafana Service Accounts, which provide a more secure and manageable authentication mechanism compared to API keys.

The transition to Service Accounts brings several advantages:

- Granular access control: Service Accounts allow for fine-grained permissions, ensuring that each account has access only to the necessary resources. This helps maintain the principle of least privilege and reduces the potential impact of any security breaches.
- Improved auditing: All actions performed using Service Accounts are logged, providing better visibility and accountability.
- Easy rotation of credentials: Service Tokens can be easily rotated without impacting the associated applications, enhancing the overall security posture.

When you install PMM 3.x, any existing API keys will be seamlessly converted to Service Accounts with corresponding Service Tokens. For more information about using Service Accounts in PMM, see [Service accounts authentication](../api/authentication.md).

### More options for deploying PMM rootless

In addition to Podman, PMM Server can also now be deployed rootless with Helm, Docker, Virtual Appliance, or Amazon AWS.

This setup prioritizes security by eliminating the need for root privileges to create, run, and manage containers. Running PMM Server as a non-root user means that you never have to give a user root permission on the host. This adds an extra security layer, crucial in safeguarding against potential security breaches.

For detailed instructions on deploying rootless PMM, check the [Setting up PMM Server](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/index.html#set-up-pmm-server) topic.

### Oracle Linux 9-based OS only

With the release of PMM 3, we are completing the transition away from CentOS/RHEL 7-based builds and fully embracing Oracle Linux 9 as the default operating system for PMM-base images. This transition began with PMM 2.38 and is now being finalized for all users, including those who previously upgraded from earlier versions using the UI upgrade option.

By leveraging Oracle Linux 9 as the default operating system, ensuring a stable, updatable and well-maintained operating system for PMM's base images.

## Improved UX

### Grafana upgraded to latest version

PMM now integrates Grafana 10.4, which delivers the following important enhancements alongside all the advancements introduced since the previous Grafana 9.2.20 integration. For the full list of changes included in this update, see [Grafana's 10.4 release blog](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/03/06/grafana-10.4-release-all-the-latest-features/).

**Improved navigation and user experience**
With the 10.4 update, PMM now includes a revamped header with search, breadcrumbs, and a reorganized menu that groups related tools together, making it easier to navigate PMM's features and find what you need:

**Improved Alerting workflow**
Leveraging the new Grafana user interface updates, we've taken the opportunity to refine the workflow for creating alerts from the **Alert Rules** and **Alert Rule Templates** pages.

You'll notice separate, more visible options for creating different types of alert rules, cutting down on unnecessary steps and making it easier to manage various alert rules, templates, and configurations:

***One central location for all Administration settings**

All PMM-related configuration and inventory options have been relocated from the **Configuration** section to a unified   **Administration** menu.
Grouping all administration-related tools together ensures easier, centralized access to all PMM configuration settings, making it easier to find what you need.

## Enhanced PMM deployment on AMI and OVF environments

PMM is now deployed inside containers within AMI and OVF instances. These containers operate in a rootless mode and are managed via Podman. This approach significantly increases security for a more robust and secure monitoring for your environments.

## Complete removal of DBaaS
In the previouse release, the DBaaS functionality was transfered to a more powerful and robust Everest.
