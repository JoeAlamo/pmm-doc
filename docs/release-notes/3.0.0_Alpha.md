Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operationsâ€”regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights

### Grafana upgraded to latest version

PMM now integrates Grafana 10.4, which delivers the following important enhancements alongside all the advancements introduced since the previous Grafana 9.2.20 integration. For the full list of changes included in this update, see [Grafana's 10.4 release blog](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/03/06/grafana-10.4-release-all-the-latest-features/).

**Improved navigation and user experience**
With the 10.4 update, PMM now includes a revamped header with search, breadcrumbs, and a reorganized menu that groups related tools together, making it easier to navigate PMM's features and find what you need:

**Improved Alerting workflow**
Leveraging the new Grafana user interface updates, we've taken the opportunity to refine the workflow for creating alerts from the **Alert Rules** and **Alert Rule Templates** pages.

You'll notice separate, more visible options for creating different types of alert rules, cutting down on unnecessary steps and making it easier to manage various alert rules, templates, and configurations:

**Related tools grouped together** 

The PMM-related configuration and inventory options have been relocated from the **Configuration** section to the dedicated  **Administration** menu. This adjustment ensures easier, centralized to all PMM configuration settings.

### More options for deploying PMM rootless

In addition to Podman, PMM Server can also now be deployed rootless with Helm, Docker, Virtual Appliance, or Amazon AWS. 

This setup prioritizes security by eliminating the need for root privileges to create, run, and manage containers. Running PMM Server as a non-root user means that you never have to give a user root permission on the host. This adds an extra security layer, crucial in safeguarding against potential security breaches.

For detailed instructions on deploying rootless PMM, check the [Setting up PMM Server](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/index.html#set-up-pmm-server) topic.

## Enhanced PMM deployment on AMI and OVF environments

PMM is now deployed inside containers within AMI and OVF instances. These containers operate in a rootless mode and are managed via Podman. This approach significantly increases security for a more robust and secure monitoring for your environments.

## API changes
This release introduces major changes to PMM public APIs for easier, more robust third-party interactions. 

If you are a third-party developer, make sure to check the API release highlights below and the full list of API
changes in the [PMM API interactive documentation](https://percona-pmm.readme.io/reference/introduction).

### Single API endpoint for all Service types
We have streamlined the process by offering single API endpoint for all Service types.
Previously, the Service type was defined by the endpoint, such as `Services/AddMySQL`. In the new approach, the Service type must be specified as the top-level property of the request payload. As part of the single API endpoint update, we have deprecated individual API endpoints for each Service type. For more information, see [Add Service](docs/api/inventory/add-service.md)
