# Percona Monitoring and Management 3.0.0

### More stable and quicker upgrades

In PMM 3, we're improving the stability and speed of the upgrading process by incorporating Watchtower, an external upgrading tool. When you click **Upgrade Now** button on the Home Dashboard, PMM now calls on WatchTower to automatically replace the PMM Docker Server container and link the new one to the existing Docker volume, all while keeping all data and settings intact.

This streamlined method fixes upgrade glitches, ensures a smoother experience for Docker, Podman, and OVF/AMI setups and enhances our testing workflows.

WatchTower commands will be integrated into the Easy-Install script starting with the Beta release. Until then, you can manually test the PMM installation via WatchTower using the instructions for [install PMM Server with Docker container manually](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/index.md).
