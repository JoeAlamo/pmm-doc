## Release Highlights

### Inventory improvements

#### Ability to update labels for existing services to PMM  

Starting with PMM 2.40.0, editing labels for existing services is easier and much more efficient. You can edit a service label directly from the PMM UI without removing and re-adding it. For more information on editing labels, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/details/dashboards/dashboard-inventory.html#editing-labels-for-a-service).

Furthermore, in our continued effort  to enhance user experience, we have redesigned the following pages to make them more user-friendly and intuitive:

- Select service type page
- Add service page


#### Connecting Services and Nodes 

Starting with PMM 2.40.0, you can click on the link in the **Node Name** column to view the node on which a specific service is running and analyze how node-level resource utilization impacts the performance of those services.

Before introducing this feature, locating the running services on a node was cumbersome. However, with this new feature, you can effortlessly access a list of services running on a specific node and identify the node name where the service is being utilized. Additionally, the filters implemented make navigation a lot simpler.[IMAGE HERE]

#### Cluster view for Inventory [Technical Preview]

Understanding the structure of your inventory is crucial. With the release of PMM 2.40.0, we've introduced an experimental feature that categorizes all your Services by Cluster, making it easier for you to understand your inventory. By using the **Organize by Clusters** toggle, you can view a group of services as a single cluster. PMM utilizes the cluster label to display services that belong to the same cluster.

### MongoDB backup monitoring 
PMM-12384: Now, PMM not only allows you to perform MongoDB backups from the UI, but it also displays backup status metrics. Additionally, we are shipping the first version of the Alert Template to notify you of any failed backups.
