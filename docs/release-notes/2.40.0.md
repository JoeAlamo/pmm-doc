## Release Highlights

### Ability to update Labels for already added Services to PMM  
PMM-11423,PMM-11148 : In the past, the only solution to fixing incorrect labels was to remove and re-add the Service to PMM. However, now it is possible to edit the instance labels directly in the UI without needing to go through that process. This update also includes an improved UI for adding remote Databases to PMM.

### Connecting Services and Nodes  
PMM-11963: It used to be difficult to figure out which Service was operating on which Node in PMM, but now things are easier. This new release lets you view a list of Services running on Nodes, along with the Node's name where the Service is being used. You can even filter by these names to make it simpler to navigate.

### MongoDB backup monitoring 
PMM-12384: Now, PMM not only allows you to perform MongoDB backups from the UI, but it also displays backup status metrics. Additionally, we are shipping the first version of the Alert Template to notify you of any failed backups.
