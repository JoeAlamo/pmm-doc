## Release Highlights

### Inventory improvements

#### Ability to update labels for existing services to PMM  

Starting with PMM 2.40.0, editing labels for existing services is easier and much more efficient. You can edit a service label directly from the PMM UI without removing and re-adding it. For more information on editing labels, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/details/dashboards/dashboard-inventory.html#editing-labels-for-a-service).

Furthermore, in our continued effort  to enhance user experience, we have redesigned the following pages to make them more user-friendly and intuitive:

- Select service type page
- Add service page


#### Connecting Services and Nodes  
PMM-11963: It used to be difficult to figure out which Service was operating on which Node in PMM, but now things are easier. This new release lets you view a list of Services running on Nodes, along with the Node's name where the Service is being used. You can even filter by these names to make it simpler to navigate.
